# Uncommon HTML Bug: Persistent Event Listener After Content Removal

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to event listeners in HTML.  When the button is clicked, the content of the div is cleared. However, the event listener remains attached to the div, which might cause unexpected behavior or even errors when the div's content is dynamically updated.

## Bug Description
The `myFunction` clears the content of the div with `innerHTML = "";` but fails to remove the event listener. This means the function is still attached to the now-empty div.  Clicking the button repeatedly leads to no visible change, the div is already empty, but the listener still keeps on firing.  This can be problematic with more complex interactions.

## Solution
The solution involves removing the event listener from the element after clearing its content. This ensures the listener is detached, preventing unexpected behavior and potential memory leaks.
